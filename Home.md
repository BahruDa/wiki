#Welcome to the Betty wiki!

## Introduction

This document describes the C coding style for [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com).  
Coding style is very personal, and **we won't force** our views on anybody.  
But we expect you to **follow this coding style for all the projects related to Holberton School**.
The Holberton School coding style is mainly inspired from the [Linux Kernel coding style](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/Documentation/CodingStyle), but it's slightly modified.  
To avoid any confusion, please refer to this guide and not the official Linux Kernel coding style.
